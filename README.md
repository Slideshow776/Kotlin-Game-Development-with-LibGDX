# Kotlin Game Development with LibGDX
These projects are [Professor Lee Stemkoski](https://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0372)'s from the book ["Java Game Development with LibGDX"](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484233238).

In no way do I claim ownership of the [code or assets](https://github.com/Apress/java-game-dev-LibGDX) used to make the code run.
This is simply for my own training and recreation.


Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Slideshow776/Kotlin-Game-Development-with-LibGDX/wiki) to see the chapter notes.

_The code is converted from Java to Kotlin._
